Project Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of mathematical utility functions implemented in Python, focusing on number theory and integer properties. The module includes a wide range of algorithms, enabling users to perform calculations related to primes, divisors, factorials, special number classifications, digit properties, modular arithmetic, and more.​

Features
Euler's Totient and Möbius functions

Prime number counting, factorization, and special prime identification (e.g., Mersenne, twin primes)

Divisor sum, count, and analysis of abundant, deficient, and proper divisors

Legendre symbol, modular exponentiation, inverse, and Chinese Remainder Theorem computations

Number property checks: palindrome, automorphic, pronic, harshad, Smith numbers, and more

Polygonal number, Carmichael number, aliquot sums, amicable numbers

Generation of Lucas and Tribonacci sequences

Digital root, mean of digits, and multiplicative persistence analyses

Usage
The functions are designed for import into Python scripts and interactive environments. Sample test cases are included as print statements within the code.​

Requirements
Python 3.x

Only standard library modules (math, typing); no external dependencies
