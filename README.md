Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of mathematical utility functions written in Python. The code implements several algorithms related to number theory, such as prime number calculations, divisor and factor analysis, and checks for mathematical properties.

Features
Euler's Totient function

Möbius function

Divisor sum and count

Prime counting and factorization

Legendre symbol calculation

Factorial calculation

Palindrome check for numbers

Mean and digital root of digits

Proper divisor and abundant/deficient checks

Automorphic, pronic, harshad, and other property checks

Prime power, Mersenne prime, twin primes detection

Aliquot sums and amicable number check

Multiplicative persistence

Modular exponentiation and inverse

Chinese Remainder Theorem

Quadratic and polygonal number analysis

Carmichael number check

Tribonacci and Lucas number sequences

Smith number detection

Usage
These Python functions are designed to be imported and used within other Python scripts or interactive environments. Major functions are tested with sample inputs (see print statements in code for examples).

python
from merged_new import eulerphi, mobius, divisorsum, primepi
To run a sample calculation, simply call the desired function with appropriate arguments:

python
print(eulerphi(36))          # Euler's Totient for 36
print(isabundant(12))        # Check if 12 is abundant
Requirements
Python 3.x

math module (standard library)

typing module (standard library)

No third-party packages are needed.
